Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018 , up from more than 19 billion in 2011.There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated fowl.

Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period .</p>

                    <p class="text-justify">The history of sushi began with paddy fields in Southeast Asia, where fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The dish is today known as narezushi, and was introduced to Japan around the Yayoi period. In the Muromachi period, people began to eat the rice as well as the fish. During the Edo period, vinegar rather than fermented rice began to be used. In pre-modern times and modern times, it has become a form of food strongly associated with Japanese culture.</p>
